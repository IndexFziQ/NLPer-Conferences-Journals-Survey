### AI: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

CCF-A, 14.050, Q1

- COMPUTER SCIENCE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - SCIE(Q1)
- www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505601/description#description
- ees.elsevier.com/artint/

The journal of *Artificial Intelligence (AIJ)* welcomes papers on broad aspects of AI that constitute advances in the overall field including, but not limited to, cognition and AI, automated reasoning and inference, case-based reasoning, commonsense reasoning, computer vision, constraint processing, ethical AI, heuristic search, human interfaces, intelligent robotics, knowledge representation, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, planning and action, and reasoning under uncertainty. The journal reports results achieved in addition to proposals for new ways of looking at AI problems, both of which must include demonstrations of value and effectiveness.

Papers describing applications of AI are also welcome, but the focus should be on how new and novel AI methods advance performance in application areas, rather than a presentation of yet another application of conventional AI methods. Papers on applications should describe a principled solution, emphasize its novelty, and present an indepth evaluation of the AI techniques being exploited.

Apart from regular papers, the journal also accepts Research Notes, Research Field Reviews, Position Papers, and Book Reviews (see details below). The journal will also consider summary papers that describe challenges and competitions from various areas of AI. Such papers should motivate and describe the competition design as well as report and interpret competition results, with an emphasis on insights that are of value beyond the competition (series) itself.

### CL: Computational Linguistics

[https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/submission-guidelines](https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/submission-guidelines)

**Aims & Scope**

*Nature Machine Intelligence* publishes high-quality original research and reviews in a wide range of topics in machine learning, robotics and AI.  We also explore and discuss the significant impact that these fields are beginning to have on other scientific disciplines as well as many aspects of society and industry. There are countless opportunities where machine intelligence can augment human capabilities and knowledge in fields such as scientific discovery, healthcare, medical diagnostics and safe and sustainable cities, transport and agriculture. At the same time, many important questions on ethical, social and legal issues arise, especially given the fast pace of developments. *Nature Machine Intelligence* provides a platform to discuss these wide implications — encouraging a cross-disciplinary dialogue — with Comments, News Features, News & Views articles and also Correspondence.

Drawing from a broad spectrum of social, biological, health, and physical science disciplines, *Nature Human Behaviour* publishes research of outstanding significance into any aspect of individual or collective human behaviour. How do humans perceive, think, feel, decide, and act? How do they interact with their environments and others? How do these abilities develop and decline over the lifespan? How do they evolve and compare with other species? How do they vary among individuals, groups, and cultures? How are they shaped by socioeconomic and political factors? How are they affected by disease or deprivation? What interventions can influence individual behaviours or outcomes? The journal welcomes research from any discipline that provides significant original insight into these questions.

*Nature Human Behaviour* features a broad range of topics, including (but not limited to) perception, action, memory, learning, reward, judgment, decision-making, language, communication, emotion, personality, social cognition, social behaviour, neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental/neurological disorders, economic & political behaviour, belief systems, social networks, social norms, social structures, behaviour change, collective cognition and behaviour, culture, public policy.

In addition to publishing original research, *Nature Human Behaviour* publishes Reviews, Perspectives, Comments, News, Features, and Correspondence from across the full range of disciplines concerned with human behaviour.

Ultimately, the journal’s mission is to strengthen the reach and impact of human behaviour research in directly addressing our most pressing social challenges.

Like all Nature-branded journals, *Nature Human Behaviour* is characterized by a dedicated team of professional editors, a fair and rigorous peer-review process, high standards of copy-editing and production, swift publication and editorial independence.

Disciplines covered in the journal include:

| Anthropology | Evolution |
| --- | --- |
| Artificial Intelligence | Genetics |
| Business Studies | Geography |
| Cognitive Science | Linguistics |
| Communication | Management |
| Criminology | Neurology |

CCF-None, 7.558, Q1
Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate, 2022): 29/145 (Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence)9/110 (Computer Science, Theory & Methods)
Online ISSN:1942-4795

The objectives of *WIREs Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery* are to (a) present the current state of the art of data mining and knowledge discovery through an ongoing series of reviews written by leading researchers, (b) capture the crucial interdisciplinary flavor of the field by including articles that address the key topics from the differing perspectives of data mining and knowledge discovery, including a variety of application areas in technology, business, healthcare, education, government and society and culture, (c) capture the rapid development of data mining and knowledge discovery through a systematic program of content updates, and (d) encourage active participation in this field by presenting its achievements and challenges in an accessible way to a broad audience. The content of WIREs DMKD will be useful to upper-level undergraduate and postgraduate students, to teaching and research professors in academic programs, and to scientists and research managers in industry.

The techniques of data mining and knowledge discovery (DMKD) are now being applied in many areas of business and government, such as banking and finance, market research, risk analysis, and counterterrorism. In the sciences, DMKD has become pervasive in such fields as bioinformatics, medical diagnosis, epidemiology, drug discovery, environmental modeling, and meteorological data analysis.

### WCS: WIREs Cognitive Science

CCF-None, 5.071, Q1
Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate, 2022): 10/90 (Psychology, Experimental)
Online ISSN:1939-5086

Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, language and communication, reasoning and problem solving, artificial intelligence, decision-making, emotion and consciousness. By its very nature, this field highlights the interrelationships among the traditionally self-contained disciplines of Cognitive Biology; Computer Science; Economics; Linguistics; Neuroscience; Philosophy; and Psychology; each of these is thus represented as a major topic covered by ***WIREs Cognitive Science***.  This journal will review research from all these fields with the potential to illuminate how the mind is structured, how it has evolved, how it develops through life, and how its functions are instantiated in neural circuits and computations.
